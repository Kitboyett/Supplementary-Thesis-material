electronically readable files 
Here I provide the electronic tables and catalogues that are included within my Thesis. Please refer to the text for details on how tables were created. 

Chapter 2: WISPS tables
I provide three tables from the chapter, these contain the photometry, the line measurements and galaxy properties. 
Photometry is given in mJy, line fluxes in erg/s/cm2, galaxy properties (SFR = M/yr, Mass = log10(M/Mo), EW = \AA, Mv = AB_mag, metal = 12 + log10(O/H))

Chapter 4: JADES target selection tables. 
These are the three catalogues for the redshift 6, 7 and 8 drop-out galaixes, shown in the Chapter and appendix. I also provide the complete sample, these contain the full set of photometry and are split into the three input papers Bouwen et al. (2015), Harikane et al. (2016) and Finklestein et al. (2015). These are given at both the 3 and 5px aperture.
